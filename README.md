# CGA-MWS-algorithm

# `JAVA` source code of CGA-MWS algorithm 

## A brief description of algorithm

* INPUT: a weighted non-binary mutation matrix `A`, a parameter `K`;
* OUTPUT: a submatrix `M`.

## Example of `txt` file input to algorithm

## The process of executing the project

1. You need to import the downloaded `my` folder, sample files `GBM_ GeneNumbers_ 920.txt` and `GBM_ removeGene_ GeneNumbers_ 911.txt` into `eclipse` or `MyEclipse` and execute them in the `JAVA8` environment whenever it is possible. Files are stored as follows:</br>

2. The `main` method in `Run.java` is the entry to the whole program.
  
3. Enter the relative or absolute path of the `txt` file in the following statement.

       String path = "GBM_removeGene_GeneNumbers_911.txt;";
   
4. Setting parameters.
   * This project provides two real data of `GBM`, `GBM_ GeneNumbers_ 920.txt` is a file processed according to the paper description, which includes `90` samples and `920` genes. And `GBM_ removeGene_ GeneNumbers_ 911.txt` is a file that deleted the genes mentioned in the paper when `K=4` is tested. The parameter `g` is given in the file name.
   * If the input sample file `GBM_removeGene_GeneNumbers_911.txt` is used, the parameter `K` can to be modified in [4,6] and other parameters remain the default in the `r.run()` statement.
   * If the input sample file `GBM_removeGene_GeneNumbers_920.txt` is used, the parameter `K` can to be modified in [2,3], the parameter `g` needs to be changed to `920` and other parameters remain the default in the `r.run()` statement. You should modify the parameters as follows:

         int g = 911;
         int K = 6;
         r.run(paths, g, K, g / 2, 1000, 0.3, 1, 1000, "calfitness_Cov");
 
     * The first   parameter:  The path of `txt` file，
     * The second  parameter:  Number of genes in `txt` file，
     * The third   parameter:  The size of Gene set (`K`)，
     * The fourth  parameter:  Population size (`N`, this value is the size of all populations combined)，
     * The fifth   parameter:  Iteration steps (`maxg`)，
     * The sixth   parameter:  Mutation probability (`Pm`)，
     * The seventh parameter:  Number of times the algorithm is executed，
     * The eighth  parameter:  Number of cycles when calculating p-value,
     * The ninth   parameter:  Model name ("calfitness_Cov"),

5. After setting the parameters, CGA-MWS algorithm is ready to be executed.

## Some supplementary notes

* If you input other custom file, please check the file format and adjust the parameters.
* When the input sample file `GBM_removeGene_GeneNumbers_911.txt` is used, and all parameters are by default, the printout of CGA-MWS algorithm after successful execution is as follows:

      NO.1  Execute the algorithm
      total time：0.5211s

      The best solution is obtained at the No.1 execution time, and the gene set is:{ PTEN, EGFR, PIK3R1, COL1A2, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, }
      Fitness: 209.6769
      CO(M): 70.5
      ME(M): 139.1769

      The average running time of (1) times executions is: 0.5211s
      p-value is: 1.0

* The seventh parameter determines how many times to execute the algorithm. If you need to set different values, here is the output print when the parameter is 3:

      NO.1  Execute the algorithm
      total time：0.598s

      NO.2  Execute the algorithm
      total time：0.422s

      NO.3  Execute the algorithm
      total time：0.248s

      The best solution is obtained at the No.1 execution time, and the gene set is:{ PTEN, EGFR, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, PDGFRA, COL1A2, }
      Fitness: 209.6769
      CO(M): 70.5
      ME(M): 139.1769

      The average running time of (3) times executions is: 0.4227s
      p-value is: 1.0
